     *
     * When OrientDB gives you a consistent response, it gets stored in an
     * internal variable of the adapter, and can be retrieved at any time.
     *
     * For example, you may want to know if ->execute('SELECT FROM ADDRESS') was
     * received properly by OrientDB, checking execute()'s return parameter,
     * then you may want to use the result of that SELECT in your code.

     * if ($adapter->execute('SELECT...')) {
     *   foreach ($adapter->getResult() as $records) {
